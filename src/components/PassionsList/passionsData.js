Since the beginning, i found coding really easy, almost natural to me. I’ve always had an algorithmical approach to problem solving, both at school and during everyday occurrencies and obstacles but, until then, i didn’t really know how to make the most out of it, beside studying and getting good marks. During the first year of university i felt the need to expand my knowledge after learning how to code in C99. That's what brought me to study Html, Css, Javascript and React by myself, besides university courses.",

I always saw him work closely with computers and electrical devices and, as the curious child i was, i followed him on site from time to time. By the age of five i already knew how to use a computer and by the age of eight i already had a joypad in my hands, both thanks to him. Videogames have been a huge part of my life for as far as i can remember and for a not-so-short period of time i even tried learning by myself how to develop them. Videogames still are, to me, not only a way-out from my everyday life, but also one of the main reasons I am the person I am today.",

At first i didn't understand the importance of reading, so i read books just to please them and to let them allow me to play videogames (they come up with a rule by which i had to read a fixed amount of pages for each hour I played my games). Not so long after, though, I discovered fantasy books. It surprised me how similar the emotions i felt reading them were to the ones i always felt during my gaming sessions. Here's when my love for books begun.",
